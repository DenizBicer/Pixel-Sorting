## Platform
* Unity 2019.2 (it'd probably work with older versions as well)

## Get Started
git clone the project as usual and open it with Unity 3D. 

In the scene **Pixel**, you can see as an example how it works in the scene.

If you want to replace the image, change the link of the **Input** parameter at the **Pixel Sort** Component.
